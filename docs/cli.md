# Command-line reference

`fabric-dw` is a command-line interface for administering Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouses and SQL Analytics Endpoints. The general invocation pattern is:

```
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] [GLOBAL OPTIONS] <noun> <verb> [ARGS] [OPTIONS]
```

!!! tip "`fdw` and `fabric-dw` are the same command"
    The CLI is installed as two interchangeable entry points: every example below can be run as either `fdw …` or `fabric-dw …`. The examples use the shorter `fdw`.

**Name-or-GUID arguments** — wherever a synopsis shows `WAREHOUSE`, `ENDPOINT`, `SNAPSHOT`, or `WORKSPACE` (positional in the `workspaces` group only), the value can be either the display name or the item's GUID. The CLI resolves names to GUIDs automatically and caches the mapping locally (see [`fabric-dw cache`](#fabric-dw-cache)).

**Positional arguments with defaults** — positional arguments shown in `[brackets]` may be omitted when a default has been set with [`fdw config set`](#defaults-fabric-dw-config). See [Defaults — fabric-dw config](#defaults-fabric-dw-config) for details.

---

## Item targets: Data Warehouse vs SQL Analytics Endpoint

Fabric has two SQL-surface item kinds:

- **Data Warehouse** — read-write, supports full DDL (CREATE/DROP/TRUNCATE TABLE, CREATE/DROP SCHEMA, CREATE/ALTER VIEW, etc.).
- **SQL Analytics Endpoint** — read-only SQL surface auto-generated over a Lakehouse. DDL and mutating operations are not supported; only read/query operations are allowed.

Each command below is labelled with one of:

- **`Targets: Data Warehouse · SQL Analytics Endpoint`** — the command works on both item kinds.
- **`Targets: Data Warehouse only`** — the command is blocked on SQL Analytics Endpoints (either by an explicit client-side guard in the source code, because it requires write/DDL capability that endpoints do not have, or because it calls warehouse-scoped REST API paths that are not available for SQL Analytics Endpoints).
- **`Targets: SQL Analytics Endpoint`** — the command operates on SQL Analytics Endpoints specifically (not on Data Warehouses).
- **`Targets: Workspace (not item-specific)`** — the command operates at the workspace level and does not target a specific DW or SQL Analytics Endpoint item.

---

## Global options

These options are placed immediately after `fabric-dw` (or `fdw`), before the command group.

| Flag | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-w` / `--workspace TEXT` | Target workspace (name or GUID). Overrides the `FABRIC_DW_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE` environment variable and the configured default. See [Selecting a workspace](#selecting-a-workspace). | — |
| `--json` | Emit machine-readable JSON instead of Rich tables. | off |
| `--auth {default\|sp\|interactive}` | Override `FABRIC_AUTH` for this invocation. | `default` |
| `-y` / `--yes` | Skip confirmation prompts on destructive commands. | off |
| `-v` / `--verbose` | Enable DEBUG-level logging. | INFO |

The `--auth` flag and the `FABRIC_AUTH` environment variable accept the same three values. See [Authentication](install.md#authentication) for the full credential chain.

---

## Selecting a workspace

Every command that operates on a workspace (everything except `workspaces list` and `cache clear`) resolves the target workspace from the following sources, in priority order:

1. **`-w` / `--workspace` flag** — explicit value passed on the root command, e.g. `fdw -w MyWorkspace warehouses list`.
2. **`FABRIC_DW_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE` environment variable** — if the flag is absent, the CLI reads this variable.
3. **Configured default** — set with `fdw config set workspace VALUE`; used when neither the flag nor the environment variable is present.
4. **Error** — if none of the above is set, the CLI prints a helpful message suggesting you set one of the above.

The `workspaces` command group is an exception: `workspaces get` and `workspaces set-collation` take the workspace as an explicit positional argument (not via `-w`), and `workspaces list` takes no workspace at all.

!!! note "-A / --all-workspaces interaction"

    Passing `-A` on the two list commands that support it (`warehouses list`, `sql-endpoints list`) explicitly scans every visible workspace. This flag is mutually exclusive with `-w` (an explicit `-w` conflicts with scanning all workspaces), but it does **not** conflict with a configured default workspace or `FABRIC_DW_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE` — the configured default is silently ignored when `-A` is used.

---

## Defaults — fabric-dw config

`fabric-dw` can store a default workspace and/or warehouse so you do not have to repeat them on every invocation.

```shell
fdw config set workspace MyWorkspace
fdw config set warehouse MyWarehouse
```

Once set, the stored workspace is used whenever `-w` / `--workspace` is not passed and `FABRIC_DW_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE` is not set. The stored warehouse value fills in optional `[WAREHOUSE]` / `[ITEM]` positionals shown in `[brackets]` in the synopsis below. All stored values are resolved in the same way as explicit arguments (name or GUID).

Resolution order for the workspace (see also [Selecting a workspace](#selecting-a-workspace)):

1. `-w` / `--workspace` flag on the root command.
2. `FABRIC_DW_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE` environment variable.
3. Value stored by `fdw config set workspace`.

The warehouse follows the same order using the optional `[WAREHOUSE]` / `[ITEM]` positional or `FABRIC_DW_DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE`.

For authentication configuration, see [Authentication](install.md#authentication).

Manage your defaults with:

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `fdw config show` | Print the current defaults. |
| `fdw config set workspace VALUE` | Set the default workspace (name or GUID). |
| `fdw config set warehouse VALUE` | Set the default warehouse (name or GUID). |
| `fdw config unset workspace` | Clear the default workspace. |
| `fdw config unset warehouse` | Clear the default warehouse. |
| `fdw config clear` | Wipe **all** configuration defaults. |

```shell
# Example — show current config
fdw config show
```

## fabric-dw sql

SQL execution and query-plan capture against a Fabric Data Warehouse or SQL Analytics Endpoint.

**Targets:** Data Warehouse · SQL Analytics Endpoint

!!! warning "Breaking change (v0.x → current)"

    `fdw sql -q "…"` has been renamed to `fdw sql exec -q "…"`.  Update any scripts or aliases that use the old form.

### sql exec

Execute a SQL statement or file against a warehouse or SQL Analytics Endpoint. Provide the query via `-q`/`--query` or `-f`/`--file` (not both). Multi-statement batches are supported; only the last result set is returned. DDL/DML statements return empty columns and rows.

!!! warning

    This command executes arbitrary SQL, including DDL and DML. Ensure you have the correct target before running destructive statements.

**Synopsis**

```
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] sql exec [OPTIONS] [ITEM]
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-q` / `--query TEXT` | SQL statement or batch to execute inline. |
| `-f` / `--file PATH` | Path to a `.sql` file to execute. UTF-8 and UTF-8 BOM files are both supported. |

Output defaults to a Rich table (rows/columns). Pass `--json` on the root command to emit machine-readable JSON (`{"columns": [...], "rows": [...], "rowcount": N}`).

**Example**

```shell
# Inline query, Rich table output (default)
fdw -w MyWorkspace sql exec SalesWH -q "SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.Sales"

# File input, JSON output
fdw -w MyWorkspace --json sql exec SalesWH -f ./queries/report.sql
```

```json
{"columns": ["id", "name"], "rows": [[1, "Alice"], [2, "Bob"]], "rowcount": 2}
```

### sql plan

Capture the **estimated** SHOWPLAN_XML execution plan for a SQL statement without executing it. The query is **not** run — only the plan is returned. This means DDL/DML query text is safe to plan without modifying any data.

The plan XML uses the standard namespace `http://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/07/showplan` and can be opened in SSMS, Azure Data Studio, or uploaded to [pastetheplan.com](https://www.pastetheplan.com) for visual analysis.

**Synopsis**

```
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] sql plan [OPTIONS] [ITEM]
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-q` / `--query TEXT` | SQL statement to plan. |
| `-f` / `--file PATH` | Path to a `.sql` file to plan. |
| `-o` / `--output PATH` | Write the plan XML to this file (recommended extension: `.sqlplan`). When omitted, the XML is printed to stdout. |

**Example**

```shell
# Print plan XML to stdout
fdw -w MyWorkspace sql plan SalesWH -q "SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.Sales"

# Save plan to file (opens in SSMS / Azure Data Studio)
fdw -w MyWorkspace sql plan SalesWH -q "SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.Sales" -o plan.sqlplan
```

### tables create

**Targets:** Data Warehouse only

Create a new table on a Fabric Data Warehouse. Two modes are available:

- **CTAS** (`CREATE TABLE … AS SELECT`) — supply `--select` or `--from-file`. The body must start with `SELECT` (leading block/line comments are allowed).
- **Empty DDL** (`CREATE TABLE … (col TYPE, …)`) — supply one or more of `--from-parquet`, `--from-csv`, `--from-schema`, or `--column`. No data is ever read or inserted; this scaffolds the table structure only.

**Synopsis**

```
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] tables create [OPTIONS] [WAREHOUSE]
```

#### CTAS options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--name SCHEMA.TABLE` | **Required.** Qualified table name. |
| `--select TEXT` | Inline SELECT statement for CTAS. |
| `--from-file PATH` | Path to a `.sql` file containing the SELECT body (UTF-8/UTF-8-sig). |

Exactly one of `--select` or `--from-file` must be provided for the CTAS path. Cannot be combined with empty-DDL options.

#### Empty-DDL options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--name SCHEMA.TABLE` | **Required.** Qualified table name. |
| `--from-parquet PATH` | Derive schema from a Parquet file (reads footer only — no data loaded). |
| `--from-csv PATH` | Derive schema from a CSV header + bounded sample (no data loaded). |
| `--from-schema PATH` | JSON file with column specs: `[{"name": "…", "type": "…", "nullable": true}]`. |
| `--column NAME:TYPE[:null\|notnull]` | Inline column definition (repeatable). Can be combined with `--from-schema`. |
| `--all-varchar` | (CSV) Force all columns to `VARCHAR`; skip type inference. |
| `--varchar-length N` | Default VARCHAR/VARBINARY length for string/binary columns (1–8000, default `8000`). |
| `--delimiter CHAR` | (CSV) Field delimiter (default `,`). |
| `--encoding ENC` | (CSV) File encoding (default `utf-8-sig`). |
| `--sample-rows N` | (CSV) Rows to sample for type inference (1–100 000, default `1000`). |

`--from-parquet`, `--from-csv`, and `--from-schema`/`--column` are mutually exclusive with each other and with the CTAS path. For the explicit-schema path at least one `--from-schema` or `--column` must be provided.

**Arrow → T-SQL type mapping (Parquet / CSV inference)**

| Arrow type | T-SQL type |
| --- | --- |
| `int8`, `int16`, `uint8` | `SMALLINT` |
| `int32`, `uint16` | `INT` |
| `int64`, `uint32`, `uint64` | `BIGINT` |
| `float16`, `float32` | `REAL` |
| `float64` | `FLOAT` |
| `bool` | `BIT` |
| `decimal128(p,s)` | `DECIMAL(p,s)` |
| `date32`, `date64` | `DATE` |
| `time*` | `TIME(7)` |
| `timestamp*` | `DATETIME2(7)` |
| `string`, `large_string` | `VARCHAR(n)` |
| `binary`, `large_binary` | `VARBINARY(n)` |
| nested / list / struct | **Error** — use `--all-varchar` or `--from-schema` to override |

**Examples**

```shell
# CTAS
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables create SalesWH \
  --name dbo.orders_2026 \
  --select "SELECT * FROM dbo.orders WHERE YEAR(sale_date) = 2026"

# Empty table from Parquet schema
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables create SalesWH \
  --name dbo.sales_empty \
  --from-parquet ./exports/sales.parquet

# Empty table from CSV header (type inference)
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables create SalesWH \
  --name staging.raw_products \

---

### tables clone

**Targets:** Data Warehouse only

Create a zero-copy clone of a table using `CREATE TABLE … AS CLONE OF`. Pass `--at` to clone from a point in time within the warehouse data-retention window.

**Synopsis**

```
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] tables clone [OPTIONS] [ITEM]
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--source SCHEMA.TABLE` | **Required.** Qualified source table to clone. |
| `--name SCHEMA.TABLE` | **Required.** Qualified name for the new clone. |
| `--at ISO8601` | Optional UTC timestamp for a historical clone (e.g. `2024-05-20T14:00:00`). Must be within the data-retention window. |

**Example**

```shell
# Clone to the current state
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables clone SalesWH \

# Point-in-time clone
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables clone SalesWH \
  --source dbo.orders \
  --name dbo.orders_may_snapshot \
  --at 2024-05-20T14:00:00
```

---

### tables rename

**Targets:** Data Warehouse only

Rename a table via `sp_rename`. The new name must be an unqualified (bare) identifier — `sp_rename` cannot move a table to a different schema.

**Synopsis**

```
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] tables rename [OPTIONS] [ITEM] QUALIFIED_NAME
```

`QUALIFIED_NAME` is the current dot-separated `schema.table_name`.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--new-name TEXT` | **Required.** New bare table name (no schema prefix). |

**Example**

```shell
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables rename SalesWH dbo.orders_2025 --new-name orders_archive_2025
```

---

### tables load

**Targets:** Data Warehouse only

Load data into a warehouse table via `COPY INTO` from either a local file or a remote URL.

**Local file path** (`--file`): the file is staged to a temporary Lakehouse in OneLake (chunked DFS upload), loaded into the target table via `COPY INTO`, and the staging Lakehouse is automatically deleted in a `finally` block regardless of success or failure. JSON files are converted client-side to Parquet (requires `pyarrow`) before staging.

**Remote URL** (`--url`): `COPY INTO` is issued directly from the given URL. For OneLake or same-tenant URLs no credential is needed. For secured external URLs (Azure Blob Storage, ADLS Gen2) supply `--credential-type` and `--secret`/`--identity` as appropriate.

**Auto-create (create-and-load)** — Pass `--create` to auto-create the target table from the source schema before loading (local files only; requires `pyarrow`). The schema is inferred from the source:

- **Parquet**: exact types are read from the Parquet footer (no row data is read).
- **CSV**: the header row and up to `--sample-rows` rows are read for type inference. Use `--all-varchar` to skip inference and force every column to `VARCHAR`.
- **JSON**: the file is converted to Parquet internally (as required for staging); the schema is read from the resulting Parquet footer.

Use `--if-exists` to control behaviour when the table already exists:

| `--if-exists` value | Table exists | Table absent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fail` (default with `--create`) | Error — table already exists | Create + load |
| `append` | Skip create, `COPY INTO` existing | Create + load |
| `truncate` ⚠️ **DESTRUCTIVE** | `TRUNCATE` existing table, then load | Create + load |
| `replace` ⚠️ **DESTRUCTIVE** | `DROP` + recreate from inferred schema, then load | Create + load |

`truncate` and `replace` are permanently destructive and require confirmation (or `--yes` / `-y`).

Use `--cleanup-on-failure` to drop the table if WE created it in this call and the subsequent `COPY INTO` fails. A pre-existing table is never dropped by this flag.

!!! warning "Not atomic"

    `CREATE TABLE` and `COPY INTO` are separate statements. A failure between them may leave an empty table. Use `--cleanup-on-failure` to auto-drop in that case.

**Synopsis**

```
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] tables load [OPTIONS] [ITEM] QUALIFIED_NAME
```

`QUALIFIED_NAME` is the dot-separated `schema.table_name` of the destination table.

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--file PATH` | — | Local file path (CSV, Parquet, or JSON). |
| `--url TEXT` | — | Remote URL (OneLake DFS or external Azure Blob). |
| `--format [csv\|parquet\|json]` | auto-detect | File format. For `--url`, only `csv` and `parquet` are supported. |
| `--header/--no-header` | `--header` | Whether the CSV file contains a header row. |
| `--delimiter TEXT` | `,` | CSV column delimiter. |
| `--encoding TEXT` | — | CSV encoding (e.g. `UTF8`, `UTF8BOM`). |
| `--field-quote TEXT` | — | CSV field-quote character. |
| `--row-terminator TEXT` | — | CSV row terminator (e.g. `\n`, `\r\n`). |
| `--credential-type [none\|sas\|managed-identity\|service-principal\|account-key]` | `none` | Credential type for secured external URLs. |
| `--secret TEXT` | — | Credential secret (SAS token / client secret / account key). Never echoed. |
| `--identity TEXT` | — | Identity for `managed-identity` or `service-principal`. |
| `--staging-lakehouse TEXT` | auto-generated | Name for the temporary staging Lakehouse (local path only). |
| `--keep-staging` | off | Keep the staging Lakehouse after load (for debugging). |
| `--max-errors INT` | — | Maximum errors before aborting. |
| `--rejected-row-location TEXT` | — | URL to write rejected rows to. |
| `--create` | off | Auto-create the target table from the source schema (local files only). |
| `--if-exists [fail\|append\|truncate\|replace]` | `fail` (with `--create`) | What to do when the target table already exists. `truncate` and `replace` are destructive and require confirmation. |
| `--all-varchar` | off | (CSV, `--create`) Force all columns to `VARCHAR`; skip type inference. |
| `--varchar-length INT` | `8000` | (`--create`) Default VARCHAR/VARBINARY length for inferred columns. |
| `--sample-rows INT` | `1000` | (CSV, `--create`) Maximum rows to sample for type inference. |
| `--cleanup-on-failure` | off | Drop the table if WE created it and the load fails. Never drops a pre-existing table. |

**Examples**

```shell
# Load a local CSV into an existing table (header row present)
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables load SalesWH dbo.sales --file data.csv

# Load a local Parquet file into an existing table
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables load SalesWH dbo.events --file events.parquet

# Load a local JSON file (converts to Parquet internally; requires pyarrow)
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables load SalesWH dbo.products --file products.json

# Auto-create the table from a Parquet schema, then load
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables load SalesWH dbo.sales --file data.parquet --create

# Auto-create from CSV, force all columns to VARCHAR
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables load SalesWH dbo.raw --file raw.csv --create --all-varchar

# Replace the existing table (drop + recreate schema + load), skip confirmation
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables load SalesWH dbo.sales --file data.parquet --create \
    --if-exists replace -y

# Auto-create; drop the table if the load fails (cleanup_on_failure)
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables load SalesWH dbo.sales --file data.parquet --create \
    --cleanup-on-failure

# Load from a remote OneLake URL (no credential needed)
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables load SalesWH dbo.orders \
    --url "https://onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/ws/lh.Lakehouse/Files/orders.parquet" \
    --format parquet

# Load from Azure Blob with SAS token
fdw -w MyWorkspace tables load SalesWH dbo.events \
    --url "https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/data/events.csv" \

## fabric-dw schemas

Manage SQL schemas on Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouses and SQL Analytics Endpoints.

!!! note "List source"

    No public REST API exists for enumerating warehouse schemas. `schemas list` falls back to TDS via `sys.schemas`, filtering out well-known system schemas (`sys`, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, `guest`, `db_*` fixed-role schemas). `dbo` is always included because it is user-writable.

!!! note "SQL Analytics Endpoints"

    `schemas list`, `schemas create`, and `schemas delete` all work on both Fabric Data Warehouses and SQL Analytics Endpoints. When `schemas delete --cascade` is used on a SQL Analytics Endpoint, views, stored procedures, and functions in the schema are dropped, but tables are **not** dropped (because `DROP TABLE` is a Warehouse-only operation on Fabric). If the schema contains tables, the final `DROP SCHEMA` will be rejected by the engine; remove the tables manually first or omit `--cascade` and drop the schema only after it is empty.

### schemas list

**Targets:** Data Warehouse · SQL Analytics Endpoint

List all user-defined schemas on a warehouse or SQL Analytics Endpoint. System schemas are excluded.

**Usage**

```shell
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] schemas list [OPTIONS] [WAREHOUSE]
```

**Example**

```shell
fdw -w MyWorkspace schemas list SalesWH
```

```
 name     principal_id
 ───────────────────────
 dbo      1
 sales    5
 staging  7
```

### schemas create

**Targets:** Data Warehouse · SQL Analytics Endpoint

### schemas delete

**Targets:** Data Warehouse · SQL Analytics Endpoint

Drop a schema from a warehouse. You will be asked to confirm unless `--yes` is passed.

Pass `--cascade` to also drop all tables and views inside the schema before dropping the schema itself. **This is a destructive, irreversible operation.**

**Usage**

```shell
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] schemas delete [OPTIONS] [WAREHOUSE] NAME
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--cascade` | Drop all tables and views in the schema first. **WARNING: permanently deletes all contained objects and data.** |

**Example**

```shell
# Drop an empty schema
fdw -w MyWorkspace --yes schemas delete SalesWH staging

# Drop a schema and all its tables/views
fdw -w MyWorkspace --yes schemas delete SalesWH staging --cascade

## fabric-dw sql-pools

!!! warning "Beta / preview feature"
    Manages workspace SQL Pools (currently in preview; the API may change before GA).  Callers must hold the **workspace admin role**.

Manage custom SQL Pools at the workspace level with sub-resource commands that mirror the Azure CLI style.

### sql-pools get

**Targets:** Workspace (not item-specific)

Fetch the full SQL Pools configuration (enabled flag + pool list) for a workspace.

**Synopsis**

```
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] sql-pools get
```

**Example**

```shell
fdw -w MyWorkspace sql-pools get
```

---

### sql-pools list

**Targets:** Workspace (not item-specific)

List all SQL pools in a workspace.

When no custom SQL pools are defined, Fabric Data Warehouse uses the default
(autonomous) workload management instead: the SQL analytics endpoint compute is
split evenly (50/50) into two isolated pools, `SELECT` (read/analytics queries)
and `NON-SELECT` (DML/DDL/ETL/ingestion statements). In that case this command
reports the default pools rather than printing an empty list. The default split
is documented in
[Workload management](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-warehouse/workload-management#compute-pool-isolation)
and [Custom SQL pools](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-warehouse/custom-sql-pools).

**Synopsis**

```
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] sql-pools list
```

**Example**

```shell
fdw -w MyWorkspace sql-pools list
```

**Output**

When custom pools exist, `--json` returns the array of custom pool objects (as
before). When none are defined, `--json` returns an object that stays honest
about there being no custom pools:

```json
{
  "customSQLPools": [],
  "default_workload_active": true,
  "default_pools": [
    {"name": "SELECT", "maxResourcePercentage": 50, "isDefault": true, "description": "Handles SELECT (read/analytics) queries."},
    {"name": "NON-SELECT", "maxResourcePercentage": 50, "isDefault": true, "description": "Handles non-SELECT (DML/DDL/ETL/ingestion) statements."}
  ]
}

## fabric-dw statistics

Manage user-defined statistics on Fabric Data Warehouses and read their details on SQL Analytics Endpoints.

!!! note

    Only **single-column, histogram-based** statistics can be created or updated (Fabric limitation). Multi-column statistics are not supported.

    DDL operations (`create`, `update`, `delete`) require a **Data Warehouse** — they are rejected client-side on SQL Analytics Endpoints. `list` and `show` work on both item kinds.

### statistics list

**Targets:** Data Warehouse · SQL Analytics Endpoint

List statistics on an item.

```
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] statistics list [ITEM] [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--schema NAME` | Filter by schema name. | (all schemas) |
| `--table NAME` | Filter by table name (unqualified). | (all tables) |

| `--auto-only` | Only show auto-created statistics. | off |

### statistics show

**Targets:** Data Warehouse · SQL Analytics Endpoint

Show details of a named statistic using `DBCC SHOW_STATISTICS`. Returns the stat header, density vector, and histogram steps.

```
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] statistics show [ITEM] QUALIFIED_TABLE STAT_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

`QUALIFIED_TABLE` must be a dot-separated qualified name, e.g. `dbo.sales`.

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--histogram` | Show only the histogram steps (skip header and density vector). | off |

### statistics create

**Targets:** Data Warehouse only

Create a new single-column statistic.

```
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] statistics create [ITEM] --table schema.table --column COL --name NAME [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--table schema.table` | Qualified table name (required). | — |
| `--column COL` | Column name to build the statistic on (required). Single column only. | — |
| `--name NAME` | Statistic name (required). | — |
| `--fullscan` | Use `WITH FULLSCAN` (default). Mutually exclusive with `--sample-percent`. | on |
| `--sample-percent N` | Sample `N`% of the table (1–100). Overrides `--fullscan`. | — |

### statistics update

**Targets:** Data Warehouse only

Update an existing statistic via `UPDATE STATISTICS`.

```
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] statistics update [ITEM] QUALIFIED_TABLE STAT_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--fullscan` | Use `WITH FULLSCAN` (default). | on |
| `--sample-percent N` | Sample `N`% of the table (1–100). Overrides `--fullscan`. | — |

### statistics delete

```
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] statistics delete [ITEM] QUALIFIED_TABLE STAT_NAME
```

---

## fabric-dw settings

Manage **server-side** database settings on a Fabric Data Warehouse or SQL Analytics Endpoint.

!!! note

    `settings` manages server-side warehouse/database configuration. For client-side CLI defaults (workspace, warehouse) use [`fdw config`](#defaults-fabric-dw-config) instead.

`show` and `result-set-caching` work on both Data Warehouses and SQL Analytics Endpoints. The `retention` command sets the time-travel retention period, which is primarily a Warehouse concept and may be a no-op on a SQL Analytics Endpoint.

The workspace is resolved from the global `-w/--workspace` option, the `FABRIC_DW_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE` environment variable, or the client-side config default. `ITEM` may be a display name or GUID.

### settings show

**Targets:** Data Warehouse · SQL Analytics Endpoint

Display all server-side database settings for an item in a single table.

```shell
fdw -w <workspace> settings show [ITEM]
```

**Example:**

```shell
fdw -w MyWorkspace settings show MyWarehouse
fdw -w MyWorkspace --json settings show MyWarehouse
```

### settings result-set-caching

**Targets:** Data Warehouse · SQL Analytics Endpoint

Enable or disable result-set caching.

Executes `ALTER DATABASE CURRENT SET RESULT_SET_CACHING { ON | OFF }` on the target.

```shell
fdw -w <workspace> settings result-set-caching [ITEM] (on|off)
```

`STATE` is case-insensitive (`on`, `off`, `ON`, `OFF`).

**Example:**

```shell
fdw -w MyWorkspace settings result-set-caching MyWarehouse on
fdw -w MyWorkspace settings result-set-caching MyWarehouse off
fdw -w MyWorkspace --json settings result-set-caching MyWarehouse on
```

### settings retention

**Targets:** Data Warehouse · SQL Analytics Endpoint

Set the time-travel retention period in days.

Executes `ALTER DATABASE CURRENT SET TIME_TRAVEL_RETENTION_PERIOD = <DAYS> DAYS` on the target.

```shell
fdw -w <workspace> settings retention [ITEM] --days DAYS
```

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--days N` | Retention period in days (1-120, required). | — |

**Example:**

```shell
fdw -w MyWorkspace settings retention MyWarehouse --days 30
fdw -w MyWorkspace --json settings retention MyWarehouse --days 7
```

---

## fabric-dw cache

Manage the local name-to-UUID lookup cache. `fabric-dw` caches workspace and item name-to-GUID mappings to avoid repeated API round-trips. Use these commands if you rename items outside the CLI or need to force a fresh lookup.

### cache clear

**Targets:** Workspace (not item-specific)

Clear all cached entries.

**Synopsis**

```
fdw cache clear
```

**Example**

```shell
fdw cache clear
```

```
Cache cleared.
```

---

## fabric-dw dbt

Scaffold a [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/) project pre-wired to a Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse using the [dbt-fabric](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/fabric-setup) adapter.

No dbt installation is required to run these commands — `fabric-dw` generates all project files itself. A `requirements.txt` inside the scaffolded project lists the required pip packages (`dbt-core`, `dbt-fabric`) so you can install them in a separate environment when you are ready to run dbt.

### dbt init

**Targets:** Data Warehouse

Scaffold a new dbt project directory connected to a Fabric Data Warehouse. The command creates the folder, writes `dbt_project.yml`, `profiles.yml`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, standard dbt model directories, a sample model, and a README. If `git` is on your PATH and the target folder is not already a git repository, `git init` is run automatically.

!!! warning "Security"

    When `--auth sp` (Service Principal) is used, `profiles.yml` emits Jinja2 `env_var()` placeholders (`{{ env_var('AZURE_TENANT_ID') }}` etc.) instead of literal secrets. You must set `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` in your environment before running dbt.

**Usage**

```shell
fdw [-w WORKSPACE] dbt init [OPTIONS] [ITEM] FOLDER
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ITEM` | Name or ID of the Fabric Data Warehouse item (optional if set via `fdw config set warehouse`). |
| `FOLDER` | Path to the folder to create. Must not exist (unless `--force` is passed). |

**Options**

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--project-name TEXT` | derived from `ITEM` name | dbt project name (sanitised: lowercase, non-alphanumeric chars replaced with `_`). |
| `--profile-name TEXT` | same as `--project-name` | dbt profile name written into `profiles.yml` and `dbt_project.yml`. |
| `--schema TEXT` | `dbo` | Default target schema for dbt models. |
| `--target TEXT` | `dev` | dbt target name inside the profile. |
| `--threads INTEGER RANGE` | `4` | Number of dbt threads (1–64). |
| `--auth [auto\|CLI\|ServicePrincipal\|interactive\|sp]` | derived from active credential mode | Authentication method. `interactive` is an alias for `CLI`; `sp` is an alias for `ServicePrincipal`. |
| `--profiles-dir [project\|home]` | `project` | Where to write `profiles.yml`. `project` writes it next to `dbt_project.yml`; `home` merges it into `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` (backs up existing file first). |
| `--with-sources` | off | Introspect the live warehouse and generate a `_sources.yml` file listing all schemas and tables. |
| `--force` | off | Overwrite an existing non-empty directory. |

**Examples**

```shell
# Minimal — uses configured default workspace and warehouse
fdw dbt init SalesWH ./my_dbt_project

# Explicit workspace via -w
fdw -w MyWorkspace dbt init SalesWH ./my_dbt_project

# Service Principal auth; write profiles.yml to ~/.dbt/
fdw -w MyWorkspace dbt init SalesWH ./sales_dbt \
  --auth sp --profiles-dir home

# Scaffold with live source introspection (auto-generates _sources.yml)
fdw -w MyWorkspace dbt init SalesWH ./sales_dbt --with-sources

# Force-overwrite an existing folder
fdw -w MyWorkspace dbt init SalesWH ./sales_dbt --force
```

## fabric-dw completion

Manage shell completion scripts. See [Shell Completion](completion.md) for full installation details.

### completion install

**Targets:** Workspace (not item-specific)

Generate and optionally install the tab-completion script for `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish`. Without `--print`, the script is written to the conventional location for the chosen shell (idempotent for bash and zsh). With `--print`, the script is sent to stdout so you can inspect or source it manually.

**Synopsis**

```
fdw completion install [--print] {bash|zsh|fish}
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--print` | Print the completion script to stdout instead of installing it. |

| Shell | Install location |
| --- | --- |
| `bash` | Appended to `~/.bashrc` (idempotent) |
| `zsh` | Appended to `~/.zshrc` (idempotent) |
| `fish` | Written to `~/.config/fish/completions/fabric-dw.fish` |

**Example**

```shell
# Install for zsh
fdw completion install zsh

# Inspect the bash script before installing
fdw completion install bash --print
```

For AI-assistant (MCP) usage there is no shell completion — see [MCP server](mcp.md) instead.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success. |
| `1` | Usage error, aborted confirmation prompt, or a Fabric API error. |
| `2` | Reserved. |
